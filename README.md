He was a vocal civil rights advocate in South Africa
After his law studies in London and a call to the bar (in 1891), Mahatma Gandhi took up a job as a lawyer for an Indian trader and businessman in Johannesburg, South Africa. He moved to Africa because he was unable to establish a thriving law practice in his home country, India. Simply put, South Africa offered him the best opportunity to practice law.

His over two-decade stay in South Africa was instrumental in shaping the person that he became. It was in South Africa that Gandhi truly came out of his shell, refining his political and social views about his environment.

While in South Africa, Gandhi received the harshest form of discrimination due to the color of his skin. On several occasions, he refused backing down and conforming to the discriminatory laws of the country. For his individual nonviolent protests on buses and trains, he was beaten a number of times. In one instance, a judge in Durban even ordered him to take off his turban. He refused complying with the judge’s order.

Fought to change how the world perceived people of color
Some historians have stated that Mohandas Gandhi devoted all of his attention only to Indians while in South Africa. He had very little, if anything, to say about the deplorable conditions of Africans in the country. Some scholars have even accused him of fueling offensive stereotypes against Africans. He once called the Africans “Kaffir”, a highly offensive term.

However, South Africa’s anti-apartheid icons such as Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu begged to differ. According to Mandela, several Africans benefited from the civil rights activism of Gandhi. It has been stated that he lent his voice to the Zulus when Britain declared war on the Zulu Kingdom in 1906. He was quick to deploy his ambulance unit to the aid of the several injured Zulu fighters. His stretcher-bearer services were not only restricted to people of color fighting in the war. Gandhi and his corps saved the lives of many wounded British soldiers as well.
